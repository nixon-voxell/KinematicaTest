# About Kinematica

Welcome to the documentation page of Kinematica. Here you will be able to access a variety of topics that get you started using the new Unity character animation system.

![](images/kinematica-demo.png)

Kinematica allows to create animated character from raw unstructured motion data (animation clips or motion capture data). This [demo](https://youtu.be/1Jt0F8F3ahY) shows a responsive player-controlled character that
navigates a complex environment, showcasing locomotion, parkour moves with precise environment contacts and
different types of climbing. We only wrote the game logic for this demo and Kinematica produces the animation poses at runtime.
